# Hi, I’m Cohen.

> I’m a passionate full-stack developer. I’ve been creating websites out of personal interest for over 6 years, which started with the basics of HTML, gradually leading into the freelance industry with international clients. More recently, I’ve been progressive to gain more experience in the back-end/data industry, fused with the development of Artificial Intelligence/Machine learning using NodeJS, creating chatbots, and a smaller scale version of GPT3 by OpenAI. In the physical world, I enjoy creating practical products. I have profound interest with Arduino, home automation with Wifi controllers (ESP32), a custom touchscreen phone written in C++, and most recently; a robot rover dog, featuring 8 control joints and ultrasonic sensors, inspired by Boston Dynamics; a company, whom inspires my passion & interest for robotics.

> Additionally, I’m an enthusiast of 3D printing for practical use cases. Complimenting the ability to 3D print based on a 3D design in Fusion360, which is able to solve an extensive array of problems in the household, or projects - which can be quickly turned into professional grade quality.
