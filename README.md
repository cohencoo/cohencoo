### Hi, Iâ€™m Cohenâ€”building digital and physical solutions driven by curiosity and creativity

I find fun in creating websites for people. I donâ€™t believe in Wix or Squarespace drag-and-drop nonsenseâ€”whereâ€™s the web design in that? True web design is bespoke, not through plug-and-play templates. To me, true web design is about craftsmanship, which led me to start [Bespoke Web Dev](https://bespokewebdev.com) after several years of freelancing.

### ðŸ’» Turning Ideas into Experiences
I thrive on building projects that push the boundaries of what I know, even if they end up shelved. From e-commerce platforms to networking apps, content management systems, and clipboard managers like [PasteMac](https://github.com/cohencoo/pastemac), every project teaches me something new. I enjoy crafting tools/applications that benefit others and make their lives easier.  

### ðŸ¤– Exploring AI and Machine Learning
Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging AI to create secure, local solutions that prioritize data confidentiality. Using tools like Ollama, Iâ€™ve developed systems that bring the power of AI to businesses while ensuring privacy and control remain in their hands.

### ðŸ”§ Arduino Hobbyist and Builder
Writing code that interacts with the real world is a hobby with endless opportunity. Tinkering with Arduinos, I've made a robot rover dog, featuring 8 control joints and ultrasonic sensors, inspired by Boston Dynamics, IR cloners that replicate remote signals and automated home devices using ESP32. Itâ€™s a rewarding challenge to bring creative ideas to life with hardware.
