## Hi, I am Cohen.

I’m a passionate full-stack developer.

I’ve been creating websites out of personal interest for over 6 years, which started with the basics of HTML, gradually leading into the freelance industry with international clients. In 2023 as a side-hustle, I registered my own business; [Bespoke Web Dev](https://bespokewebdev.com), managing website development on an increasingly larger scale.

I’ve been progressive to gain more experience in backend development, fused with AI, ML using NodeJS, creating chat-bots and AI solutions for software. In the physical world, I enjoy creating practical products. Using Arduino, I've created home automated devices with WiFi compatibility (using ESP32), a custom touchscreen phone written in C++, and most recently; a robot rover dog, featuring 8 control joints and ultrasonic sensors, inspired by Boston Dynamics.
