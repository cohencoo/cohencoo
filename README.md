# Hi, I’m Cohen.

> I’m a passionate full-stack developer.

I’ve been creating websites out of personal interest for over 6 years, which started with the basics of HTML, gradually leading into the freelance industry with international clients. In 2023 as a side-hustle, I registered my own business; [Bespoke Web Dev](https://bespokewebdev.com), managing website development on an increasingly larger scale.

I’ve been progressive to gain more experience in backend development, fused with AI, ML using NodeJS, creating chat-bots and AI solutions for software. In the physical world, I enjoy creating practical products. Using Arduino, I've created home automated devices with WiFi compatibility (using ESP32), a custom touchscreen phone written in C++, and most recently; a robot rover dog, featuring 8 control joints and ultrasonic sensors, inspired by Boston Dynamics.

Additionally, I’m grateful for the skill to 3D print for practical use cases, such as household solutions and product prototyping through the use of Fusion CAD modelling.
