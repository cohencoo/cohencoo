# Hi, I’m Cohen.

> I’m a passionate full-stack developer. I’ve been creating websites out of personal interest for over 6 years, which started with the basic of HTML, gradually leading into freelance work with international clients. More recently, I’ve been progressive to gain more experience in the back-end industry, fused with the development of Artificial Intelligence/Machine learning using NodeJS, creating chatbots, and a smaller scale version of GPT3 by OpenAI. In the physical world, I enjoy creating practical products. I have profound interest with Arduino, home automation with Wifi controllers (ESP32), creating intricate systems, a custom touchscreen phone written in C++ and my most complex project; a robot rover dog, featuring 12 actuator activated joints and ultrasonic sensors inspired by Boston Dynamics, a company, whom inspires my passion & interest for robotics.
